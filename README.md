Why does this exist
------------
Christmas present for my dad 2019!

Requirements
------------

To create a smiliar UI from your own data you will need:
 - a Google sheet containing your data. Mine has the following headings - 
    - ID
    - Season
    - League
    - League Tier
    - Date
    - Opponent
    - Home/Away	Score
    - Position
    - Points
    - Competition	
    - Match Notes
    - Got/Want
    - Programme Price
    - Programme Notes
 - A google project connected to your sheet (I used [this very helpful Twilio tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGN6EUi4Yio) )
 - Your google project credentials saved as environment variables

Usage
-----
via the browser: https://davidscobblersdatabase.co.uk

Development
-----

To run locally:

 - Clone the repo to your machine
 - Do $ `npm install`
 - Create a .env file with your google config variables
- Update `renderLandingPage.js` to point to your google sheet: `new GoogleSpreadsheet('[MY_SHEET_ID]')`
- run locally with `$ nodemon app.js`

Things still to do
---------------------

- modal to push page down rather than up
- on table view, if match is clicked on, do edit inline?
- transition on show and hide
